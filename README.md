# GPACalculator
gpa calculator that determines your current grade / what grade you need to achieve a certain grade

Inspiration for creating this:

I always hear a lot of people always asking what their current grade is, how to calculate it, what grade they need to pass/achieve a certain grade so I decided to make a program for this.

-Program will allow the user to input the weights of their grades, for example exams are worth 30%, quizzes are worth 10%.

-Users also input their grades and it will automatically calculate the user's current grade.

-Also has an option to show the user what grade they need to achieve a certain cutoff. Ex. need a 75 on final exam to get a C.

-Also shows you how grades will affect your cumulative GPA , and what grades you need to achieve to get a certain GPA.
